## 🚨 Flagship SOC Automation Platform — Agentic SOC Analyst

### 🧠 Agentic SOC Engine (AI Threat Hunting Core)
AI-powered SOC automation engine that converts analyst intent into safe KQL hunts, baselines normal activity, pivots investigations, maps kill-chain stages, and guides escalation decisions.

**Tech:** Python • Azure Log Analytics (KQL) • Microsoft Defender • OpenAI

## 🚨 Threat Hunting & Incident Response

- 🕵️ **[Threat Hunt: Tor Browser Usage](https://github.com/tleanne1/threat-hunting-scenario-tor/tree/main)**  
  Tracked unauthorized Tor browser installation and usage on a corporate asset. Analyzed device events, process telemetry, and network activity to detect encrypted browsing over non-        standard ports.

- 🧪 **[Incident Response: Zero-Day Scenario](https://github.com/tleanne1/threat-hunting-scenario-zero-day)**  
  Simulated a zero-day exploit against an enterprise endpoint. Investigated suspicious behavior, extracted IOCs, and documented containment, eradication, and recovery steps.

- 📄 **[Incident Response: Keylogger Investigation](https://github.com/tleanne1/threat-hunting-scenario-keylogger)**  
  Identified persistent keylogging malware through registry and file system artifacts. Used Defender telemetry and KQL to map infection timeline and disable startup mechanisms.

- ☁️ **[Threat Hunting: Azure Abuse Incident](https://github.com/tleanne1/threat-hunting-Azure-Abuse-Incident)**  
  Responded to brute-force authentication attempts targeting Azure resources. Used Microsoft Defender for Cloud and KQL to investigate anomalous logon activity, correlate IP intelligence,   and trace lateral movement.
  
- 🕵️‍♀️ **[Threat Hunting: The Great Admin Heist](https://github.com/tleanne1/The-Great-Admin-Heist)**  
  Investigated an APT-style attack targeting a privileged IT admin. Used Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and KQL to uncover malware disguised as a fake antivirus, detect keylogger     deployment via `.lnk` files, and trace persistence through registry keys and scheduled tasks. Documented full attack chain, timeline, and response actions.
